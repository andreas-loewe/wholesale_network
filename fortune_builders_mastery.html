            <h1>To Fortune Builder Mastery Students</h1>
            <p>This site is for you!</p>
            <p>Are you a wholesaler or a rehabber? If either of these describes you, then you have found your gold mine.</p>
            <p>The first lesson that Than Merrill teaches is to <b>Build Your Lists</b>.  Meet people, get their contact info, and add them to your list so that 
                you can market your deals quickly and effectively. <u><b>We've built the list for you!</b></u></p>
            <p>We are trying to create a <b>"Craigslist"-like site for real estate investors just like you</b>. This site is:</p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Low cost for wholesale sellers and free for wholesale buyers (rehabbers)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Easy to use</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Private and Secure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will not share your email address. Direct all communication through our site until you are ready to talk directly to the other party.</p>
            <h2>Choose Your Site</h2>

                    <h3>Sell a Wholesale Deal</h3>
                    <p>You want to be a real estate investor, but you lack the cash. Wholesaling is a quick way to generate money to "get in the game." 
                        You find the property. You negotiate the sale price for well below market, and you sign the purchase agreement. Then you sell the 
                        agreement to the people who have the cash to close the deal.</p>
                    <p>As a Wholesaler, you don't need a large bank account, you just need drive, and the ability to negotiate great deals!</p>
                    <a href="seller.html" class='btn btn-danger'>Go to Our Wholesaler's Site</a>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                    <h3>Buy a Wholesale Deal</h3>
                    <p>You have the cash to do major repairs, but you lack the properties to work on. Wholesalers have the contracts for properties but lack the cash.
                        It's the perfect match.</p>
                    <p>On our Cash Buyer's site, you gain access to wholesale deals as they become available. We advertise to find the Wholesalers, and they 
                        tell us each time they have a deal. You decide if the deal is right for you and only make a move on the deals that are right for you!</p>
