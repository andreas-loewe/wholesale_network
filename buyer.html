                    <p>This list is for you if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You have recently attended a Real Estate Investment (REI) seminar like FortuneBuilders, Rich Dad, or other.</li>
                        <li>You are buying properties below market value.</li>
                        <li>You are buying properties with CASH.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Use this list to grow your real estate investment business more quickly. Get emails from wholesalers who have contracted to buy distressed property 
                        from distressed homeowners. Wholesalers frequently do not have the money close on the deals they negotiate, so they sell the deal to you for a small profit 
                        so that you can make an even bigger profit.</p>

                    <p>Wholesalers, who have limited budgets, advertise for home 
                        sellers and negotiate contracts below market value. Once under contract,
                        they look to <b>assign</b> or <b>resell</b> their deals to 
                        people like you who have enough cash to make the purchase 
                        or the repairs, which are outside their budget. They 
                        collect an assignment fee when they sell the deal do you.</p>

                    <h3>Why this site exists</h3>
                    <p>My wife, Tarah, and I attended a FortuneBuilders seminar, 
                        and we immediately became enveloped in the wonder of real estate investing. 
                        We got to work looking for people to sell us deals. 
                        In the process of building our 
                        list of wholesalers, we realized that it would be a lot easier 
                        if wholesalers came to us instead.</p>
                    <p>When we advertised for Wholesalers we met 
                        lots of investors who had deals outside our area. It 
                        was such a shame to say goodbye to those good deals and 
                        see them go to waste.</p>
                    <p>We had the idea that by creating a central list of people 
                        like us, we could attract a lot of wholesalers with a lot 
                        of deals, and even though those deals would not all be 
                        right for us, we would be 
                        copied on those deals that were right, and that would 
                        be a valuable thing to help our business grow!</p>
                    <p>Since we started this site, the list has grown tremendously. Because 
                        of people like you, this site has become a must-stop location for 
                        wholesalers who are looking to close quickly. By using this site 
                        to send out a deal notice, they are instantly connected to thousands of 
                        people like us who have a chance to review the deal and make an offer. As a result,
                        now that we are on the list, Tarah and I no longer hunt for wholesale dealers. Now, 
                        we sit back and check our e-mail and let the deals come to us!
